AWS S3 Event Triggering Project 🚀
Automate notifications and get instant updates for your S3 bucket uploads! 📁

Welcome to the AWS S3 Event Triggering Project! This project shows how to create an AWS Lambda function that is triggered whenever an object is uploaded to an S3 bucket. The Lambda function sends a notification via Amazon SNS, notifying the subscribers about the uploaded object. This project uses Python and Boto3 for lambda function and the rest entire infrastructure is made using shell.
